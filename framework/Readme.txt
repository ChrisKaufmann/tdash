1. Compiling
-------------

Compilation will be via Simple Build Tool (SBT), which is like GNU make, but tailored for scala.
Run ./sbt.sh

Commands for sbt can be entered as arguments on the command line, or in sbt's interactive shell.

To build a compiled jar, the command is "package".
To get further help the command is "help"

For example,

  $ ./sbt.sh help
  $ ./sbt.sh package
